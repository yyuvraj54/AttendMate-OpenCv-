## Introduction

The Face Attendance Tracker is a Python application that leverages the OpenCV library for face detection and recognition. The primary goal of this project is to streamline the attendance tracking process by automating the identification of individuals through facial recognition technology.

## Features

- Face detection and recognition using OpenCV
- Automatic attendance marking in an Excel sheet
- User-friendly interface for easy operation
- Configurable settings for different environments and scenarios
- Error handling to ensure robust performance

## Installation
